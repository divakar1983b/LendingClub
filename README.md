# LENDING CLUB CASE STUDY
> Lending Club is a marketplace for personal loans that matches borrowers who are seeking a loan with investors looking to lend money and make a return.
> When the company receives a loan application, the company has to make a decision for loan approval based on the applicant’s profile. Two types of risks are associated with the bank’s decision:
* If the applicant is likely to repay the loan, then not approving the loan results in a loss of business to the company.
* If the applicant is not likely to repay the loan, i.e. he/she is likely to default, then approving the loan may lead to a financial loss for the company.
* If one can identify these risky loan applicants, then such loans can be reduced thereby cutting down the amount of credit loss. 
* Identification of such applicant’s using EDA is the aim of this case study.
